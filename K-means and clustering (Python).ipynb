Other tools exists as well, such as the [Silhouette method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)). Elbow is a simple approach to model selection in k-means, but it does not always provide clear answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elbow-method measures the distance between data points and their cluster centroids (using sum of squared errors, sse). The metric's values can range from 0 (all items in the clusters are at the same point as their centroid) to positive infinity (nodes are all over the place). When the number or clusters (k) increases, the SSE score decreases. The goal in using the Elbow is to balance between increasing model complexity and understability and interpretability of the results."
